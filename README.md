# CANtina
CANtina is a CAN bus star PCB inspired by Team 5883's PCBs and developed by 6502 DARC SIDE's Electrical Subteam.
* CANtina utilizes Weidmuller LSF-SMT-3.5 push-to-connect terminal blocks to allow easy connection of all your devices
* CANtina has built in resistors in order to allow you to maintain the correct impedance.
* CANtina is Open Source!

## Warning:
Star topology can be very fussy. It violates the ISO 11898 standard and is not officially supported by any manufacturer. Team 6502 does not reccomend star topology for any applications that are not for the purposes of education, research, or hardware and software development. **Please be careful!**
